# Happy Thoughts

Week 11 project at the Technigo Bootcamp! We were supposed to make a webapplication where you can post and like your happy thoughts. 

## The problem

I read all the material and watched the livesessions and then I tried to structure my project. It was difficult keeping track of the different APIs and the components on top of that. If I had more time I would have liked to do some animation when the user sends his/her happy thought.
